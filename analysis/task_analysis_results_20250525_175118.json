Here are some estimates:\n- **Graphic Design**: Average $25-$100 per project.\n- **Content Writing**: Average $20-$75 per article.\n- **Social Media Management**: Monthly retainers could range from $100-$500 depending on the scope.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n- **Time Management**: Prioritize high-demand gigs to maximize earnings.\n- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on delivering quality work to build a reputation and gain repeat clients.\n\nBy following this plan, I would aim to maximize earnings ethically and transparently, with all efforts focused on delivering value to clients.
